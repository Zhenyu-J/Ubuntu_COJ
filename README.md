* User can run the code by clicking ‘run’ button. The execution result will be displayed to user.
* User can browse pre-stored coding problem list.
* User can get details of a specific coding problem by clicking the problem in the list.
* User can submit the code through ‘submit’ button to submit the code to solve the chosen question. The result, including compiling, correctness and running time, will be presented.
